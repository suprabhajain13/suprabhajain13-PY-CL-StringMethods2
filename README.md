# PY-CL-StringMethods2

## Overview
This project focuses on demonstrating various string manipulation methods in Python. The project contains implementation files for string operations, unit tests to verify the implementations, and an entry point script to execute the demonstrations.

## Files

### app.py
The app.py file serves as the main entry point for the project. It imports functions from lab.py to demonstrate different string manipulation methods such as:

- Getting the length of a string.
- Accessing characters at specific indices.
- Slicing strings.
- Concatenating strings.
- Repeating strings.
- Converting strings to uppercase and lowercase.

### lab.py
The `lab.py` file contains implementations of string manipulation functions. Each function provides instructions and challenges to complete. The goal is to fill in the necessary code to meet the requirements outlined in the comments.

### lab_test.py
The `lab_test.py` file contains unit tests for the functions defined in `lab.py`. It ensures that the implemented functions behave as expected by testing them with various input cases.

## Project Structure
- src/
  - main/
    - app.py
    - lab.py
  - test/
    - lab_test.py

## Getting Started
1. Open the `src/main/app.py` file.
2. Review the code and ensure that all necessary functions from `lab.py` are imported.
3. Run the `app.py` file to see the demonstrations of different string manipulation methods.
4. Modify the `lab.py` file to complete the challenges and demonstrations.
5. Avoid making changes to the test files (`lab_test.py`).
6. Run the test cases (`lab_test.py`) to verify the correctness of your implementations.

## Conclusion
This project provides hands-on experience with string manipulation methods in Python. By completing the challenges in `lab.py` and running the test cases, you can enhance your understanding of string operations and improve your Python programming skills.

Happy Coding!
